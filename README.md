# m-ld Gateway

The Gateway is an open source service that provides secure message delivery
and durable storage of data, for collaborative web apps using [**m-ld**](https://m-ld.org/).

It can be used as:
- ðŸ“¨ A **message relay server**, so apps don't have to deploy a message broker or other pub-sub system.
- ðŸ—„ A **backup data store** for **m-ld** domains, so an app doesn't have to provide durable persistence of its own.
- ðŸ“  A **"sidecar" container** of **m-ld** domains for server-based environments which not have a native **m-ld** engine.
- ðŸ§± A building block for **custom gateway services** dedicated to specific apps.
